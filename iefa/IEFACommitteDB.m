             @"PrepKit" : @"1. Topic question \n\n In the light of the continually declining voter turnout in European and national elections: in an age wherein the world's leading democracies are making a shift into the digital world, what should Europe do to revitalise its democratic culture? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Technology and the internet have transformed our world. Robust development of the digital market in the last decades has brought many benefits and simplified many day-to- day tasks from shopping to catching a taxi. However, the great potential of technology is not being used efficiently in the political sphere. Moreover, low voting turnouts and passive political participation amongst the youth evidence that young people are becoming less interested in politics, while being integrated in numerous social and commercial platforms due to technological advances. Several member states have implemented digital solutions such as e-voting, but the results were not unequivocally satisfying, and have raised controversies in some cases with Netherlands having to abandon the practice after its electronic voting machines were hacked, calling into question the reliability of the new technology (http://www.eui.eu/News/2013/02-12-InternetvotingasuccessintwoEuropeancountries.aspx). \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n Turnout is seen as a litmus test for the EU Parliament's democratic legitimacy by many, but it has fallen steadily from 62% in 1979 to 42.54% in the 2014 election (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/election-results-2014.html). Young people represent one of the least politically active groups of society. Yet this is arguably the most tech savvy group, with different habits when it comes to most day-to- day tasks. Thus, a minor task such as registering for an election by postal service is often seen as an obsolete chore. Growing indifference of the youth towards politics has been one of the main causes of low voting turnout. It has disabled them from having active involvement in the decision making process resulting in unsatisfactory level of political participation and political activism.Thus, taking into account the youth's active online participation, engaging them through digital channels and political activities that would include technological advances could have a positive impact and stimulate their interest towards politics. On the other hand, elderly people - who are the most active representatives of society in politics - face difficulties with adapting to modern technologies and lack digital skills. Moreover, this digital divide (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news/eu-digital-divide-infographic) exists not only between different generations, but between Member States as well, as a result of national and regional development disparity. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n Civil society: Main actors of elections, whose active participation results in high voter turnout. Parliament Members: Representatives of politically active group of society. European Parliament: Sets a direction that is defined by the group of society who has voted. NGOs: protect the rights of minorities and social groups whose views do not match with the one that is set by the Parliament. \n\n 5. Measures in place and legislative background \n\n In order to make it possible for every EU citizen to have an active and equal political contribution, the EU has set regulations regarding citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals. Directives state that every citizen of the Union has a right to vote and stand as a candidate in election to the European Parliament in his Member State of residence. (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:026:0027:0029:EN:PDF) The Parliament of Estonia adopted an act regarding e- voting in 2002, which came in force in 2005, assumed that e-voting would increase voter turnout. However, researches have shown that the system is not fully reliable and it can be hacked to alter the vote. (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/12/estonian-e-voting-security-warning-european-elections-research) Among many initiatives to increase voter turnout was a project of the European Students' Forum AEGEE-Europe (http://www.aegee.org/aegee-europe-launches-y-vote-2014/) aiming at increasing youth participation in the European Parliament elections of 2014. The initiative mainly concentrated on empowering young europeans to make an informed choice. Nonetheless, the 2014 EP elections showed the lowest ever voting turnout. Nonetheless, the 2014 EP elections showed the lowest ever voting turnout. \n\n 6.

Topic question \n\n Protection of the national legal standards and differentiation of illegal tax evasion from legal tax avoidance: How should the EU deal with financial havens, offshore accounts and tax- avoidance regulations in its Member States and EaP countries, having in mind scandals caused by the leakage of 'Panama Papers'? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Tax evasion, financial havens and the rising number of offshore accounts have turned into a huge economic problem for both EU and EaP countries. Due to a lack of information exchange between countries, its citizens and their offshore accounts, tax evasion not only puts in disadvantage ordinary tax payers, but also results negatively on the economic stability of the Member States. It should be also noted that contrary to tax avoidance, tax evasion is considered to be an illegal action, and both are directly related to shadow economy. In order to avoid the additional tax burden, which is being increased due to the growing needs of the state for financial resources, business entities (both legal entities and individuals) use various methods and schemes of tax evasion. One of such methods is opening offshore accounts, which enables different entities to hide their financial statements and avoid taxes. Offshore financial centers are thought to be one of the reasons of the financial crisis of 2008. In 2016 the data from the fourth largest offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca was leaked and made public, causing an international scandal. The so- called Panama Papers showed the ways many authorities and multinational companies avoid taxpaying by hiding their offshore accounts, as well as made it clear that the measures that have been taking place by now are not efficient enough; it is reported that nearly € 1 trillion (http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/tax_fraud_evasion/a_huge_problem/index_en.htm) is lost yearly due to tax evasion and avoidance. Taxes are used to develop the economic state of countries, so investing them into a country's economy would result in a potential growth. This issue has an ethical problem as well: why should someone pay more taxes while some people are not paying their share? While in the EU countries this issue can be fought along with 28 member states, the issue with EaP countries is more complicated. The tax evasion and avoidance rates in these countries mostly come from the high level of shadow economy. The corruption level still stands on a high point, as well as the low level of legislative performance. It often happens that high level authorities and companies that fight against hiding taxes are doing it themselves by opening offshore accounts. As a result of combating offshore accounts and disclosing them, there might be more increasing control of the movement of excess liquidity in the monetary policy framework; filling of budget resources; combating global terrorism and money laundering; arresting accounts in offshore banks. For the non-democratic governments, this will mean the opportunity to fight against oligarchic groups by means of selective control of offshore transactions. \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n Tax avoidance - acting within the law, sometimes at the edge of legality, to minimise or eliminate tax that would otherwise be legally owed. (http://media.arbeiterkammer.at/wien/PDF/studien/Studie_tax_avoidance.pdf) Tax evasion - happens when the taxpayers, i.e. both individuals and corporations, are avoiding to pay taxes and pay less in illegal ways, by hiding their income. Contrary to tax avoidance, it is considered to be an illegal action. Tax haven - laws and other measures of a haven can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. (http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf) Offshore account - any bank account that is opened outside of your country of residence. Having an offshore account is not illegal, but hiding the actual fact of having it is illegal. Panama Papers - A giant leak of more than 11.5 million financial and legal records exposes a system that enables crime, corruption and wrongdoing from the database of the world's fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca.

Measures in place and legislative background \n\n Collecting taxes and combating tax evasion are both Member States competencies. EU is working towards having a maximum information exchange among Member States, national tax authorities and tax regulations. EU established different expert groups that work on different aspect of the issue, such as Code of Conduct on Business Taxation group that is established to ensure a full assessment of EU countries tax regimes to identify harmful tax measures and a Tax Policy Group that has been established as a platform for EU finance ministers to discuss possible ways of dealing with tax avoidance. OECD in cooperation with EU and other governments is also in charge of fighting against tax havens and tax avoidance. Anti Tax Avoidance Package was set to to help Member States to fight against tax avoidance and to tackle company's tax payment.

Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Despite considerable economic development in the last decade, Turkey, a candidate country for accession to the European Union (EU), has been widely criticised as increasingly autocratic, as demonstrated by the 2015 Progress report on Turkey describing its shortcomings in human rights protection and severe restrictions on freedom of expression, which stand in the way of Turkey's accession. While the country remains far from fulfillingthe criteriaforentryintothe EU, the current refugee crisis serves as an apt opportunity to deepen cooperation between the two. \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n The crisis and ongoing dialogue between the EU and Turkey resulted in the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan, activated on 29th November 2015. The deal constitutes of a comprehensive account of commitments from both sides and aims to reduce the influx of irregular refugees into the EU and grant access to one vetted refugee in Turkey for every refugee returned from Greece to Turkey. While the Joint Action Plan has helped significantly reduce the number of irregular refugees arriving in Greece and many of the commitments have been put in place1, the deal has come under fire from Amnesty International, which conducted reports on the outcomes and developments of the deal. One major component of the deal is establishing visa-free access to Turkish citizens travelling to the EU for up to 90 days. The requirements Turkey must fulfil in order to be eligible for the visa- free regime are stipulated in the roadmap towards the agreement. The criteria, however, have not been met by the deadline set by the EU, which has become a setback for the continuing dialogue regarding Turkey's accession to the EU, the talks about which began in 2005 and out of the 35 chapters only one had been closed since. One of the 72 requirements is an amendment of Turkey's anti-terrorism laws, which have been used to silence criticism of Turkey's government, but explaining it is amid conflicts with the Kurdish separatist movement PKK and the Islamic State, Turkey refuses to amend the laws. The situation in Turkey is being complicated by many factors, accession talks threaten to alienate other EU Member States, conflicts within Turkey are slowing dialogue, but it is essential to continue to work out a solution with Turkey for the refugee crisis while aiming to improve its position in the next Annual Progress Report. \n\n 4.

As the situation in the Mediterranean is proving problematic, the EU has demonstrated commitment to solve this issue through partnership agreements and a common fisheries policy. However, the EaP countries lack a coherent policy on this issue, which causes overfishing and extension of certain species in the waters of EaP countries. What should be the levers of the EU assistance to the EaP countries to tackle the posed issues? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Currently, each person eats on average 19.2kg of fish a year – around twice as much as 50 years ago. While illegal and unregulated fishing constitutes an estimated 11- 26 million tonnes (12-28%), almost 30% of fish stocks commercially fished are over-fished. Overfishing occurs when more fish is caught than the population can replace through natural reproduction. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities whose chief source of labor and revenue hinges on healthy, plentiful stocks of fish. \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n Open access nature of fisheries and governmental subsidies A main problem of overfishing is the “open access” nature of fisheries. Because there are no or few property rights in the EaP countries, there is a lack of incentive for fishermen to leave fish in the water. Moreover, many governments in EaP countries still continue to subsidize their fleets, allowing unprofitable operations to subsist, and overfishing to occur. Another key dimension of the overfishing crisis is illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing. Short term benefits vs. long term sustainable development While fish and seafood are among the most traded commodities worldwide and a lot of people depend on this industry, it will only be profitable in the long-term if it detaches itself from short-term profit and pursues a sustainable fishing, which is not only about catching less fish, but catching the right fish, in tolerable quantities, whilst sparing others. Sustainable fishing techniques and a better management will help fish stocks recover and result in more, high quality fish being caught. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n The European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the EU. The Commission monitors current legislation, represents the Union in foreign relations and has the exclusive right to initiate legal text on the European level. EaP countries The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is an initiative of the European Union governing its relationship with the post-Soviet states of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. CSOs Civil society organisations – CSOs are organisations which are pursuing a common purpose for the public interest. Engaging CSOs in participatory research in an effective way can help to fight against illegal fishing and overfishing. Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) Under the auspices of the Common Fisheries Policy, RACs were established by Council Decision (EC) 256/2004 with the intention to increase the participation of those affected by the CFP in the fisheries management decision-making process. They are the main body for engaging with stakeholders on issues that directly (fisheries management and research) and indirectly (e.g. windfarms, aggregate extraction, conservation planning) affect fisheries. European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) The EMFF is the fund for the EU's maritime and fisheries policies for 2014-2020. The fund helps fishermen in the transition to sustainable fishing, supports coastal communities in diversifying their economies, finances projects that create new jobs and improve quality of life along European coasts and makes it easier for applicants to access financing. \n\n 5. Measures in place and legislative background \n\n The Common Fisheries Policy The CFP stipulates that between 2015 and 2020 catch limits should be set that are sustainable and maintain fish stocks in the long term. Another increasingly important aim is to reduce unwanted catches and wasteful practices to the minimum or avoid them altogether, through the gradual introduction of a landing obligation. Fisheries management is based on data andscientificadvice,andcontrolmeasures to ensure that rules are applied fairly to and complied with by all fishermen. The European Commission's consultation paper on 2014 fishing opportunities The European Commission's consultation paper on 2014 fishing opportunities, published on 30 May, highlighted the progress being made towards ending overfishing. \n\n 6. Questions \n\n How does the EU influence and control the EaP countries' legislature regarding fishing? \n How did the measures taken by the EU already help to face the problem of overfishing and how can the same framework be implemented in EaP countries? \n What are the possible tools of monitoring fishing, especially in the places of high fishing capacity? \n\n 7.

Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Degrading and overcrowded structures do not guarantee a human treatment to prisoners all over Europe, preventing them from being re-educated and ready to re-integrate into society at the end of their sentence, with statistics showing how recidivism tops 70% in some European countries (http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/crimeprevention/Introductory_Handbook_on_the_Prevention_of_Recidivism_and_the_Social_Reintegration_of_Offenders.pdf) page 7.   Prison's staff - Security, prisoners' welfare and rehabilitation depend to a large degree on well-trained prison staff. However, the recent strike of prison guards that has been on for weeks in Belgium (http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/24/europe/belgium-prisons/) is emblematic of the critical situation, where governments fail to replace retiring guards and to guarantee flexible working hours, limiting guard's ability to do social work with prisoners. Medical conditions - Detainees serve their sentence in an inhuman environment where even medical and psychiatric support are scarce, as overcrowded facilities represent breeding ground for infectious and psychiatric diseases (HIV is 20 times more present among prison inmates than the general population, hepatitis C 100 times (Source: http://www.epha.org/a/2457)) and suicides are consistently more frequent than in the normal population (http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/249188/Prisons-and-Health.pdf (pag 87) \n http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/prisons-and-health/focus-areas/mental-health). Solitude - Inmates often spend long hours locked in their cell with almost no contact with other people, topping 23 hours per day (https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/Prison%20conditions%20in%20France.pdf (pag 27)). Families also cover a fundamental role in preventing them from losing touch with society, as not losing contact with their beloved ones has proven to be extremely effective for prisoners, like the example of conjugal cells in the USA and Romania has shown. \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n   Punishment or Rehabilitation - this is the core conflict on detention facilities, as their purpose can be either to punish or to rehabilitate. While some argue that punishment is the only option, others claim that if a criminal is not a threat to society, the main purpose of a sentence should be of rehabilitating rather than punishing.   Detention vs Alternative Sentencing - on the one hand, incarceration is said to ensure non-convicted citizens' safety more than alternative sentencing, as offenders might commit other crimes. Others claim that the latter is not only less expensive but can also lead to lower rates of recidivism (http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people), rehabilitatingoffenderstotheirfuturelife inside the community. Private investment vs Prisoners renovation Imprisonment conditions currently fail to meet minimum standards, especially regarding floor space (For the construction of new prisons, the minimum floor space recommended is 5.4 m2 per detainee, whether he is alone in the cell or shares it with another person. The minimum distance between the cell walls must be 2.15 m and the ceiling must be at least 2.45 m high. Source: https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc_002_0823.pdf (page 16)) and food quality. To improve detainees' life conditions, some propose to encourage private investment in the sector, that is present in the UK and very common in the USA, while others propose to make detainees cultivate their own food and renovate present structures as part of their rehabilitation programme. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n   Prisoners people confined or held in custody as the result of a legal process. The Committee on Prevention of Torture(http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm) organises inspections in places of detention with the goal of assessing the treatment of those deprived of their liberty. At the end of each inspection a report is sent to each Member State. The Committee Against Torture (http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CAT/Pages/CATIntro.aspx) is the body of 10 independent experts (http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CAT/Pages/Membership.aspx) that monitors implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel (http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx), Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx) by its State parties.    The European Prison Observatory (http://www.prisonobservatory.org) studies the condition of national prison systems and the related systems of alternatives to detention, comparing these conditions to the international norms and standards relevant for the protections of detainees' fundamental rights.The International Centre for Prison Studies (http://www.prisonstudies.org/) conducts research into prisons, aiming at raising awareness about the principles on which the use of imprisonment should be based and informing improvements in prison policies and practice, within a human rights framework. Despite not holding legislative power, human rights activists and NGOs such as Penal Reform International (http://www.penalreform.org/), Amnesty International (https://www.amnesty.org/en/), Human Rights Watch (https://www.hrw.org/it) and Children of prisoners (http://childrenofprisoners.eu/about-us/who-we-are/) have a significant impact on legislative bodies and often ignite changes in the treatment of prisoners. \n\n 5. Measures in place and legislative background \n\n   The area of freedom and justice falls under the shared competences (Shared competences (Article 4 of the TFEU): the EU and EU countries are able to legislate and adopt legally binding acts. EU countries exercise their own competence where the EU does not exercise, or has decided not to exercise, its own competence. Source: ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3Aai0020)) of the EU. The Nelson Mandela Rules (http://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/1957/06/ENG.pdf) aim at ensuring that prisoner's human rights are respected. The Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1452519849535&uri=CELEX:32008F0947) aims at facilitating the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons, improving the protection of victims and of the general public, and facilitating the application of suitable probation measures and alternative sanctions.   The European Prison Rules (https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805d8d25) aim to avoid violation of fundamental human rights and to preserve prisoner's rights and conditions. They also concern imprisonment conditions and educational programmes.   The European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf)aim s at ensuring that human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected across the European Union. Prison staff working in the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe are expected to respect the European Code of Ethics for prison staff (https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805cabb7) \n\n 6. Questions \n\n   Should social rehabilitation be the objective of every sentence or should the EU differentiate its approach towards different offenders (e.g. violent and nonviolent)? \n What kind of activities should the EU encourage to facilitate social reintegration of prisoners? \n Can building more prisons help prisoners to live in less inhuman conditions and therefore facilitate their future reintegration in society? \n What should the EU do to improve the quality of work of prison guards? \n Should all prisoners be allowed to vote without any distinctions? \n How should the EU cope with the different laws and judicial systems among Member States? \n\n 7.

Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n The recent escalation known to be the 4-day-war at the Nagorno Karabakh and Azerbaijan border (http://civilnet.am/2016/04/21/karabakh-4-day-war-international-media-coverage/#.V2Y3-rt97IU), as well as the ongoing crisis in the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine, hasshowedtheinstabilitywithinthe EU Neighbourhood and marked the importance of undertaking actions to prevent future military progress in the regions of frozen conflicts. The mentioned conflicts present at the areas of Transnistria, Abkhazia, South-Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Crimea pose a constant threat to security and stability, and thus commit the EU to dealing with them. Due to the unpredictability of their consequences, the continuous possibility of the renewal of military actions in these zones are food for thought for international communities and key actors such as the EU, Russia and other neighboring countries, especially now when some “frozen” conflicts seem to erupt more often. As Sergei Mikheev, head of the Moscow- based Center for Political Affairs mentioned; 'There was never a month when someone was not killed, when there was no shooting...'. Despite having different backgrounds, development routes and scales, those areas are similar with their impact concerning democratization and human rights violations. Illegal armed formations harassing journalists and political activists in Crimea shortly after the annexation, cases of both Pro-Ukrainian activist and Tatar disappearances, banning newspapers and the right to freedom of speech, killings of civilians and even kids (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35949991), a sizeable number of casualties and refugees, are a few examples of such actions in the mentioned territories. Moreover, hundreds of incidents are reported each year, such as shelling, shootings, kidnappings, explosions and mines placed along the administrative separation lines.\n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n Despite numerous attempts to put frozen conflicts into the framework of various integration projects, they are still far from being resolved. That poses a dilemma: Is regional integration ineffective in dealing with the conflicts of identity or separatism, or is it the differences of the progress of the conflicts themselves or the environment they are developing in? The serious involvement in handling these conflicts is not a problem-free enterprise. One of the necessary conditions for resolving the conflicts is that the countries involved are stable, prosperous, democratic, strongly committed to the rule of law, human rights and minority rights, which often is not the case in the mentioned areas. With the exception of the Nagorno- Karabakh conflict, the role of the Russian- speaking minority is huge. It opens up an opportunity for continuous Russian support of the Transnistrian, Abkhazian and South Ossetian self-proclaimed states. However, many observers ascribe the lack of overall progress being made in the solving of the frozen conflicts to Russia's role. They argue that Russia sees as the best way for it to control and influence its neighbours by maintaining the ambiguous situation regarding the conflicts and by de facto increasing its links with the breakaway regions (In the last decade, Azerbaijan has used billions of dollars of its oil wealth to buy a formidable arsenal of new weapons,many of them purchased from Russia. Armenia has also strengthened its defenses with weapons acquired from Russia at discounted prices http://civilnet.am/2016/04/03/dangerous-days-in-karabakh-thomas-de-waal/#.V2Yvr7t97IU). This double-standard policy coming from such an important key stakeholder in the conflict, makes the situation more complicated making the two sides dependent from Russia, which has its own interests in the conflicts. This way, it is argued, Russia is creating a ”shadow empire”. On the other hand, on practical level, not much is done by the institutions that were created to work on regional stability and ensure peace at the borderlines. One of such organizations is the OSCE that could only verbally condemn the incidents that happened in the territories of “frozen” conflicts. As it is the case of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, the political elite in power might not always be keen on resolving the conflict peacefully, as on the base of human lives they carry on their interests (http://www.lragir.am/index/eng/0/politics/view/35635). Another issue in the topic is the situation of the refugees from the conflict areas. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are 230,000 displaced persons currently in Georgia. More than 800,000Azerbaijanisweredisplacedfrom Nagorno Karabakh and the other six districts occupied by Armenia after the war; 230,000 Armenians who lived in Azerbaijan (http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/perConcordiam/pC_V1N2_en.pdf, pg 15). With the hope of the conflicts to be sometime resolved peacefully, the lives and situation of these people remains pending and unsettled. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n Many international actors are involved in the search for solutions, including the OSCE, the UN, the United States. Several countries of the region (Ukraine, Turkey, Russia, Iran) have an important role in resolving the conflicts. The EU has in recent years significantly increased its contribution to the resolution of the frozen conflicts. All of these countries have now joined the European Neighbourhood Policy and Action Plans have been agreed with all of them (signed with Moldova in February 2005, with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in November 2006). \n\n 5.

What model of the intellectual property rights protection will assist EaP countries to boost growth and better integrate in the European framework? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n The protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) has become one of the most contentious issues in global commerce. Several trends – globalization of technology and skill, emergence of new technologies, and the rapid development of emerging economies – have jointly elevated the importance of IPR protection, both politically and commercially. In promoting economic development at the microeconomic level, patent, copyright, and similar forms of intellectual property protection provide a means by which innovators and investors can recover the investment of time and money needed to bring a new product to the market. At the macroeconomic level, intellectual property promotes economic development by encouraging domestic innovation and foreign direct investment. The debate concerning the economic implications of intellectual property rights (IPRs) has gained considerable attention in the context of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and the subsequent increase of regional and bilateral free trade agreements in the TRIPS-plus era. One of the most prevalent forms of IPR violation is counterfeiting, copyrights infringement and the use of pirated materials. In terms of copyright materials being pirated, the largest category was business software ($5.69 billion, or almost half of the lost revenue); it was followed by records and music ($2.44 billion). Losses from pirated entertainment software ($1.74 billion) and motion pictures ($1.64 billion) were about the same. \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n Public interest issues: Public interests wider than the mere protection of private rights are at stake in the case of counterfeiting. These include the protection of:  public health and safety \n tax and customs income \n local and regional industries \n foreign investment and investor confidence \n international trade relations \n the prevention of corruption and organized crime Public health issues: Counterfeiting medicine is a severe IPR violation and can result in health damage for people and lower the credibility of the health system (WHO International Conference on Combating Counterfeit Drugs: Building Effective International Collaboration) Organized crime, tax and customs losses: The major import of counterfeit goods is that of cigarettes, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, according to the European experience. The rise of charges of counterfeiting or piracy may also give rise to other alternative or additional charges, which include fraud, tax evasion, money laundering,food and drug legislation, labor related legislation,etc. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n   Government / governmental enforcement agencies (Legislative, Executive, Judicial branches) of EaP countries (to ensure the adoption, execution and protection of the IPR related laws and policies) EU and partner countries (to cooperate with EaP countries in standardizing the IPR system and developing the IPR practices) Foreign & domestic investors (to encourage economic development through long-term investment practices) Corporations & business companies (to ensure the protection of their tangible and intangible assets through IPR system) Innovators/ authors/ musicians/ writers/ artists ( the protection of their innovation potential and creativity and its transfer into market value and competitiveness) \n\n 5.

Topic question \n\n Although the EU has been consistently contributing to institutional reforms and development of anti- corruption policies in EaP countries, corruption remains one of the most striking problems in all six EaP member states. What new approach should the EU take to ensure institutional reforms against corruption practices in the EaP region? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is an initiative of the European Union inaugurated in 2009 to strengthen the relationship of the EU with and provide closer economic and political integration of these 6 post- Soviet states; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The EaP initiative is controlled directly by the European Commission and intended to provide an avenue for discussions of trade, economic strategy, and travel agreements among other issues. The fight against corruption is seen as one of the most important challenges in order to achieve progress towards deep democracy and the rule of law among EU partner countries. Corruption remains a major problem in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, threatening economic development and political stability as well as the credibility of governments. EaP countries continue scoring relatively low on the Democracy Index by country, scoring as low as 2.71 (Azerbaijan) and 3.62 (Belarus), marking the region of eastern Europe as the one with the most dramatic regression during the decade since the Democracy Index was launched. According to the Corruption Perception Index, the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia-95, Azerbaijan-119, Georgia-48, Moldova-103, Belarus-107, Ukraine- 130) except Georgia hold a rather low ranking in the world (https://www.transparency.org/cpi2015/#results-table). \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n One of the main conflicts to be taken into consideration is the lack of transparency in any situation of corruption. When corruption is deeply rooted in the administrative levels of a country's government, it is hard to identify corruption and its extent. It is even harder and more complicated to get official reports on it to try and resolve it. Moreover, to be able to rid a country of corruption the government of the said country must be willing to cooperate with international key players that are able to help in this respect. Additionally, citizens' faith in their government must be restored if they are to willingly help create a governmental administration without corruption. Significantly, in Moldova and Ukraine 80% and 87% of citizens respectively perceive the judiciary to be corrupt or extremely corrupt. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n  The European Union, composed of 28 member states, holds an interest (as explained above) in strengthening its relationship with its Eastern Partners in light of trade interests and a general greater cooperation. EaP countries wish for greater cooperation with the EU in the advancement of their efforts to bring greater innovation and expansion in the business sector of their countries, as well as further boost the wellbeing of society by increasing the quality of the living standard by ridding the countries of the corruption that exists with the help of the EU. \n\n 5. Measures in place and legislative background \n\n Eastern Partnership Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial meeting (http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/138934.pdf) in October 2013 in Luxembourg, where the home affairs part focused but was not limited to the fight against corruption. The participants \n - the Ministers responsible for Justice and Home Affairs of the EU Member States and the EaP countries and representatives of the European Commission \n - expressed their commitment to continuous cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs. Association Agreement endorsed at Vilnius by Moldova and Georgia, European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) providing financial assistance to support anti- corruption interventions Anti-Corruption Network for Eastern Europe and Central Asia provides a regional forum for the promotion of anti- corruption activities, the exchange of information, elaboration of best practices and donor coordination via regional meetings and seminars, peer-learning programmes,andthematicprojects.

The Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan supports anti-corruption reforms through country reviews and continuous monitoring of implementation of recommendations (https://www.oecd.org/corruption/acn/istanbulactionplan/) Training provided by the EU to help experts in EaP countries identify and exterminate corruption (http://www.coe.int/t/DGHL/cooperation/economiccrime/corruption/Projects/EaP-CoE%20Facility/EaP_default_en.asp) \n\n 6. Questions \n\n How can the citizens' faith in their governments be restored? \n How can the EU help increase the transparency at the administerial level of these countries' governments in order to help identify and prevent corruption? \n Are the measures taken today efficient and what are the outcomes? \n\n 7.

And my favourite quote is “The information remains, but the source is forgotten”, implying that people should praise themselves more in front of the others – because others will eventually forget who has told them that – but the information will remain 😛",
             @"PrepKit" : @"1. Topic question \n\n The influx of refugees into Europe has caused a rise of ultra-right political circles throughout Europe. Taking into account this situation what measures should the EU take to prevent further escalation of the similar phenomena? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Europe is facing the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War with many people being forcibly displaced from their homes due to violent conflicts in their geographic regions, especially in the middle East. In 2015 alone around 1 million people \n - refugees, displaced persons and other migrants \n – had made their way to Europe seeking basic human rights protection (http://ec.europa.eu/echo/refugee-crisis_en). While the trend in the first few months of 2016 seems to be decreasing, and only 156,000 people have reached Europe in April, the number of incoming asylum seekers may increase as the weather becomes warmer. The refugee crisis itself and Angela Merkel's stance on welcoming refugees to Europe has dominated political discussions across Europe. Many have become Eurosceptic due to the EU's inability to handle the ongoing refugee inflow into Europe. It is this disillusionment of the European public that has provided the right environment for the far-right parties to grow and gain increasing popularity (http://uk.businessinsider.com/map-shows-far-right-growth-across-europe-2016-3). In Austria and throughout Europe, the success of the far-right may be attributed to the fears of the locals created by the large inflow of refugees into Europe. As written by Rainer Nowake, the editor of Die Presse, the leading center-right daily, “Despite Austria's outward prosperity, people fear that it won't go so well for much longer.” (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/world/europe/austria-presidential-election.html) Mr. Hofer's Freedom Party, who's motto is “Austria first” campaigned on strengthening the country's border's and its army, limiting benefits for immigrants and favoring Austrians in the job market, which clearly appealed to the concerned Austrian public and won him 49.7 percent vote in the presidential election (about 30,000 votes away from victory) (Ibid).Other parties across Europe that also hold extreme anti-immigrant views have largely succeeded to appeal to the public and gain parliamentary power. For example, in Poland, the right-wing party Law and Justice has become the largest party in the parliament, with 235 seats out of 460 seats, while Hungary faces popularity of 2 right-wing parties simultaneously, Fidesz and Jobbik as first and third most popular parties respectively (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/poland-parliamentary-elections.html?_r=0, http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html?_r=3). In France the far-right National Front party has reached its largest score ever, winning 6.8 million votes in regional elections in 2015 (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36150807). In Germany, the far-right party established only in 2013 has been recognized as the third most popular party in Germany by the German news site The Local. It is the first right-wing party to enter the Parliament after WWII. Considering the increasing popularity and success of the far-right parties who hold strong anti-immigrant and mostly Eurosceptic views, it may be asserted that the current measures implemented by the EU institutions and Member States are not very effective in dealing with the refugee crisis. \n\n 3. Measures in place \n\n European Agenda for Migration – With European Agenda for Migration the EU aims at taking immediate action to prevent further losses of migrants' lives at sea by providing additional funding to Frontex joint search and rescue operations, to the safe and legal resettlement of people to Europe, to the Regional Protection and Development Programmes and to the most affected Member States located at the EU's external borders (http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/index_en.htm). European commission attempts at solving the crisis with 4 main approaches: \n - Providing emergency support within the EU: in 2016, the European Commission will provide €83 million humanitarian funding to assist the emergency support projects mainly in Greece (http://ec.europa.eu/echo/refugee-crisis_en). \n - Helping transit countries with humanitarian funding: Since the very start of the Syrian crisis in 2011, EC has provided around $455 million to Turkey. Moreover, in November 2015, with the agreements signed and the decision of setting up the Refugee Facility for Turkey, the EU institutions and the Member States committed to funding up to $3 billion to alleviate the inflow of refugees from Turkey (Ibid). \n - Putting the EU Civil Protection Mechanism at the disposal of Member States or the neighboring countries: Through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the Commission coordinates the delivery of immediate material to support Member States and neighbouring countries facing major peaks in the refugee crisis that overwhelm their immediate response capacities (http://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en). \n - Scaling up humanitarian aid for major crises. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n - EU population \n -Political parties in different EU member and neighboring states \n – both left, centrist and right-wing parties who are affected by the general situation in Europe, including that created by the refugee crisis, where those belonging to the right-wing ideologies are gaining popularity as opposed to left-wing parties \n - European Union – 28 member states who are directly or indirectly affected by the refugee crisis and the increasing far- right popularity \n - Displaced people – refugees, migrants, etc. who have been granted the status of refugee or have been waiting in camps around Europe, waiting for the protection of their basic human rights \n - European Commission: The executive body of the EU responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, etc. As leading global donor, the European Commission gave more than €1 billion or some 72% of its annual humanitarian aid budget in 2015 to projects helping refugees and displaced people in over 30 countries (http://ec.europa.eu/echo/what-we-do/humanitarian-aid/refugees-and-internally-displaced-persons_en). Commission's main partners include UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the Red Cross and Red Crescent family and non-governmental organisations \n\n 5. Questions \n\n 1. Why are far-right parties gaining power in Europe? \n 2. Why have the current measures proven to be ineffective? What other alternatives could be implemented? \n 3. How can the EU manage to stay committed to its human rights stance regarding refugees while it deals with the far-right rise across Europe? \n 4. What's the attitude the EU should have towards far-right movements: one of hostility and confrontation or appeasement and system inclusion? \n\n 6.

             @"PrepKit" : @"1. Topic question \n\n Considering that COP21 Summit in Paris has paved the way for a global climate deal, what actions can the EU take to promote a global emissions trading scheme, similar to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)? \n\n 2. Explanation of the problem and relevance of the topic \n\n Last December, the COP21 Summit in Paris ended in the Paris Agreement, in which 196 parties concluded that emissions should be reduced in the battle against climate change (http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/what-was-cop21/). With developing nations needing industrialization to fuel their emerging economies, receiving annual monetary assistance (http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/items/2807.php) (as part of the arrangement) in hopes of reducing their emissions and promoting use of climate-friendly technologies may not be enough to further their growth. The European Union, at the forefront of emission reduction with their Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), has decreased emissions by about 5% since 2013, the start of Phase 3 of the scheme (http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/index_en.htm). Witnessing the initial success of the EU ETS, the possibility of implementing a global emissions scheme, based on the EU ETS as a model, arises. However, the problem of the Paris Agreement not being implemented due to lack of ratification is hindering the idea of a global climate deal. \n\n 3. Main conflicts \n\n The COP 21 Summit in Paris has aimed to mitigate the current effects of climate change, however as with any international agreement reached by consensus, it is not perfect. So far, only 177 of the 195 nations have signed the agreement (https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&lang=en, Signing the agreement is not legally binding, it only expresses a political commitment; the agreement must be ratified by the countries themselves, and pass through their each individual internal parliamentary procedure [http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/01/after-cop21-what-needs-happen-paris-agreement-take-effect]), and out of the signatories, only 17 (https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&lang=en) states have deposited their instruments of ratification, only accounting for 0.04% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions. Based on Article 21, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement, “the Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Depositary (http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php).” Thus, even if a nation has signed, and ratified the agreement, it will not be implemented until these requirements are achieved. Apart from the legal issues that surround the Paris Agreement, there are also logistical issues with respect to climate change. The caps on greenhouse gases and emissions as put forward by the agreement are considered to be loose, and will most likely lead to a global warming of 2.7 to 3 degrees Celsius above pre- industrial levels, far from the aimed 1.5 degrees (https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations). In addition to this, developing nations are apprehensive that the compensation of $100 billion provided to them annually for climate finance will not be enough to protect them against the 'loss and damage' mechanism (http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/12/what-does-paris-agreement-do-finance). Due to this, there is speculation that the developing signatories will not actually ratify the agreement (http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/03/29/developing-nations-urged-to-boycott-paris-agreement-signing/). Another perspective is the unfairness to tell emerging economies, such as those of the BRICS countries, to reduce their industrial emissions output, which has aided their own rapid growth, when many developed countries were passing through this very same stage a century ago. Major powers, who are equally to blame for the harmful emission of greenhouse gases, are criticizing the current growth of countries,trying to develop using industry. Furthermore, the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted by each nation prior to the COP21 can be considered ambitious. The fact of the matter lies in who will be monitoring the INDCs, what incentive will be given to follow them, and if they are more than just a mere statement. \n\n 4. Stakeholders \n\n The United Nations (UN) and the 195 parties (194 and the EU) of the COP21 Summit in Paris: All of the participants decided on the Paris Agreement, and the need to combat the effects of global warming by reducing emissions, creating national climate action plans, determining their future contributions (INDCs) before the COP21 and agreeing to gather once every five years to set more ambitious goals as well as striving towards transparency. The European Union (EU): The EU is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after The People's Republic of China and the United States. However, despite its high emissions percentage, it also has initiated the EU ETS, the world's first and largest carbon market. EU signed the Paris Agreement as a body; however, for the EU to be allowed to ratify the agreement, all of its Member States must have done so before it. BRICS and other developing nations: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) are rapid growing economies and some of the world's major emerging nations. As a result of their industrialization, they are the 7th ,5th ,4th ,1st and 20th largest contributors to greenhouse emissions. For developing nations, reducing greenhouse gases will affect their growth, hindering the progress they have already made. \n\n 5. Measures in place and legislative background \n\n The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): An international environmental treaty created at the Earth Summit in 1992. The 197 parties of the UNFCCC have met annually since 1995 in the Conferences of Parties (COP), to assess the effects of climate change, resulting in the Kyoto Protocol, Cancun and Paris Agreements. The Paris Agreement: The brainchild of the COP21 Summit in Paris, the agreement aims to reduce emissions, via nationally determined contributions (INDCs), increase transparency and global stock tale, as well as adapting to deal with the impacts of climate change and providing enhanced international support for developing countries. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) are national climate action plans put in place by each participant prior to the COP21 Summit, taking into consideration national priorities and circumstances of each country, with the goal of keeping temperature rise up to 2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial temperatures. The Green Climate Fund (GCF): The financial mechanism by the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement. It invests in low-emission and sustainable development. Established by the 195 parties of the Paris Agreement to limit and reduced greenhouse gases in developing countries. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): The world's first and largest carbon market, it is a tool used to reduce industrial greenhousegasemissions,where acapis set on the total amount of a greenhouse gas, and the cap is lowered over time. It is currently operating in 31 countries – in all EU Member States as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Companies therefore receive or buy emission allowances and can trade them, when needed. If a company exceeds its annual emissions, it is fined. \n\n 6. Questions \n\n How can the EU promote a globally efficient scheme, taking into account the needs of the developing countries as well as not impeding the process of ratification of the Paris Agreement? \n What measures should be taken to create an efficient global emissions trading scheme taking into account that the caps on greenhouse gases and emissions as put forward by the Paris Agreement are fairly loose? \n What incentives should be given to countries to follow their INDCs, and join the global emissions scheme? \n How will developing countries, who need industrialization to boost their economies, be motivated to join this global scheme? \n\n 7.
